For milestone 3, the majority of my work focused on document handling, as saving and opening files had already been implemented. 

A new data structure will be used for the document, essentially consisting of a doubly-linked list for each character in the row, with pointers to each next and preceding row. This structure is still being prototyped and has not been implemented in the project at this time.

No other features were changed during this time; much of the work is focused on moving the project over to the new repository.
